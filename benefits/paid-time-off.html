					<h2 class="display-6">Paid time off</h2>

					<p>
						We want our team to be happy and refreshed, and to maintain a healthy work-life balance, so every employee
						earns generous paid time off that can be used freely for vacations and adventures, time with loved ones,
						appointments, sick days, jury duty, and just about anything else. This is in addition to company observed
						holidays.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">How it works</h3>

					<p>
						You’ll earn a specific amount of paid time off each year based on how long you’ve been with our company, as
						shown in the table below:
					</p>

					<table class="table">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th scope="col">Years of service</th>
								<th scope="col">Paid time off, per year</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>

						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>0-2</td>
								<td>3 weeks</td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
								<td>2-4</td>
								<td>3.5 weeks</td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
								<td>4+</td>
								<td>4 weeks</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>

					<p>
						The amount you earn is converted to hours (where 1 week equals 40 hours for full-time employees or the
						number of hours you work in a week for part-time employees) and then divided by the number of pay periods
						per year to determine the amount you earn each pay period.
					</p>

					<blockquote class="bg-light border-start border-3 px-3 py-2">
						For example, let’s say you’re full-time and currently earning three weeks of paid time off each year (120
						hours). Assuming a semi-monthly pay period, that equates to 5 hours of paid time off each pay period.
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						Accrued paid time off rolls over from year-to-year; however, you can only accumulate a maximum of 4 weeks of
						paid time off at any given time (we want you to take advantage of it!).
					</p>

					<p>
						New employees will begin accruing paid time off during their first full pay period. Newly hired employees
						will begin with three days of paid time off to help out in the event something unexpected comes up early
						into their employment.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">How to use</h3>

					<p>
						Paid time off can be used by notifying the person you report to as early as reasonably possible and gaining
						approval. Different reasons for requesting time off will naturally have different expectations for how early
						you’re able to send notification.
					</p>

					<p>
						It’s preferred that you don’t dip too low into your paid time off balance, to ensure you can cover
						unexpected time off (like illness).
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Unused balance</h3>

					<p>Any unused PTO balance will be paid out with the final paycheck if an employee leaves the company.</p>
