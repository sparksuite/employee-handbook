					<h2 class="display-6">401(k)</h2>

					<p>
						We’ve partnered with a high-tech, ultra low-fee provider to manage our employees’ 401(k)s. Their platform
						and customer support are just as focused on transparency and clarity as we are. This makes it easy for you
						to manage your investment fund and goals and ensures you have the greatest amount available at retirement.
						In addition, we offer exceptional company matching to incentivize our employees to save for retirement.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Company matching</h3>

					<p>
						To encourage long-term savings, we’ll match your 401(k) contributions dollar-for-dollar up to 4% of your
						salary. This begins with your first paycheck.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Vesting</h3>

					<p>All funds contributed to your 401(k), including company matching, are 100% immediately vested.</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">How it works</h3>

					<p>
						When hired, you’ll automatically be enrolled for a 401(k) with a default contribution of 4%. You can adjust
						your contribution amount at any time via our 401(k) provider’s online interface. The desired amount will be
						withdrawn from your paycheck pre-tax and contributed directly to your investment fund.
