					<h2 class="display-6">Flexible working hours</h2>

					<p>
						Team members are free to choose the start & end times that work best for them each day! You’re free to begin
						each day between 7am-10am and finish each day between 4pm-7pm after completing 8 hours of work.
					</p>

					<p>
						The start & end times you choose can change day by day, and you don’t need to let anyone know when you plan
						to arrive or leave each day (as long as it’s within the windows described above). Need to come in later one
						day and earlier the next? Go for it!
					</p>

					<p>
						Team members also have the flexibility to take breaks as desired throughout the day. To ensure our team can
						collaborate efficiently, significant breaks should be avoided during the shared 10-4 hours, aside from a
						reasonable lunch break. However, periodic small breaks during this time are encouraged—whether it’s to enjoy
						a cup of coffee, grab a snack, go for a walk, or challenge a teammate to a quick game of ping pong or
						cornhole. Since breaks don’t count toward the amount of time worked each day, each team member is entrusted
						with the ability to manage their time according to their own individual preferences for how they work best.
					</p>

					<p>
						On the off chance a more significant break needs to be taken during your workday, just be sure to
						communicate this with your manager in advance so that they’re aware. These types of breaks should be rare
						but are permitted without taking PTO as long as it doesn’t interfere with your ability to complete a full
						workday.
					</p>

					<p>
						Employees generally still have access to the office outside of the 7-7 working window, but working outside
						of these hours should be reserved for extreme circumstances (like a software outage that needs immediate
						attention). However, feel free to enjoy the games or game tables at the office anytime with friends +
						family!
