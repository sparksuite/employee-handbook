					<h2 class="display-6">New parent leave</h2>

					<p>
						All full-time employees, regardless of gender, can opt to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid new parent leave.
						This time is typically used for the new parent to welcome the new child or children into their home, but can
						also be used near the end of pregnancy for medical reasons.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">How it works</h3>

					<p>
						An employee is considered a new parent four weeks before the birth of a biological child, upon adoption of a
						child, or upon receiving a foster child. The 12 weeks must be used within 1 year of the birth, adoption, or
						placement (respectively) of the new child. The leave can be taken consecutively or intermittently as needed.
						During the 12 weeks, you will not receive your usual salary, but health benefits will continue.

						missed benefit deductions are caught-up.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">How to use</h3>

					<p>
						New parent leave can be used by notifying the person you report to as early as reasonably possible and
						gaining approval. Under normal circumstances, at least several weeks notice is expected. New parent leave
						can be taken in whole-day increments.
