					<h2 class="display-6">Flexible remote work</h2>

					<p>
						To promote a healthy work-life balance, all full-time team members can work remotely up to 2 days each week,
						with extra remote days available to accommodate unexpected situations (details below). Each team member has
						full control over when they choose to use their remote days—no approval or advance notice needed.
						<em>
							Part-time team members may not be eligible for remote work due to in-office needs; this detail will be
							made clear in any part-time job opening / offer letter.
						</em>
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Extra remote days</h3>

					<p>
						Full-time team members accrue one extra remote day on the first day of each quarter, up to a balance of 10
						extra remote days. You can use these extra remote days to work remotely more than twice in a week. While
						it’s up to each team member to decide how and when to use their extra remote days, we recommend reserving
						these for unexpected situations.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Replenishing extra remote days</h3>

					<p>
						Full-time team members have the opportunity to earn half of an extra remote day in order to replenish a low
						balance. When you have fewer than 3 extra remote days in your balance, this half extra remote day can be
						earned by working 5 full days entirely from the office within one workweek, and it will be added to your
						balance on the following Wednesday.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Mixed days</h3>

					<p>
						If needed, you can work part of the day from the office and part of the day remotely. This counts as a
						remote day, so you’ll need to have a remote day available to do this. If you need to switch your work
						location, just be sure to inform your manager in advance and update your work location status.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Guidance</h3>

					<p>
						Be sure to choose and/or create a working environment that is suitable for productive work. This would
						include:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>A fast, reliable internet connection</li>
						<li>Your laptop and any other supplies/gear you need</li>
						<li>Noise-level and surroundings conducive to the type of work you do</li>
						<li>Sufficient time to work as much as you would have at the office</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						When choosing which days to work remotely, take into consideration your commitments and responsibilities,
						like whether you have meetings, company-wide events, etc. Be sure to notify team members who may be impacted
						by you working remotely that day.
					</p>

					<p>
						Working remotely generally requires more effort to ensure it’s effective and productive. It will take extra
						work to ensure you’re still collaborating well with your teammates and exceeding their expectations. At the
						end of the day, your teammates are counting on you just as much as when you’re at the office.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Why not 100% remote?</h3>

					<p>
						As a tech company, much of our work can be performed from anywhere. Yet, we’ve found that we’re more
						collaborative and productive as a team when working from a co-located environment. Plus, working in-person
						with fellow team members fosters a stronger team culture and more meaningful connections.
					</p>

					<p>
						To make co-located working the best possible experience, we’ve invested heavily into creating one of the
						most enjoyable office environments around, with plenty of snacks, indoor/outdoor break areas, ample private
						offices, stellar coffee, standing desks, and so much more. Our office was designed with team member feedback
						to be a place people genuinely want to work from.
