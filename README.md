# Sparksuite's Employee Handbook

Greetings! We've open sourced our employee handbook so that team members, prospective employees, and others can track the changes we've made over time and contribute to it as it evolves. Although it's stored on GitHub, we decided to structure the handbook as a static website so that non-technical team members could view it easily too. To check out the handbook, visit: https://handbook.sparksuite.com/.

If you'd like to contribute to our handbook, you can do so via a pull request. If this project has helped your team out, or if you simply admire it, we'd love a star!
