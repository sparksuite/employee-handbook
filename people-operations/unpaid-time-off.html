					<h2 class="display-6">Unpaid time off</h2>

					<p>
						We want to maximize flexibility for our team, so in addition to our paid time off policy—including company
						observed holidays—team members have the option to take unpaid time off. However, because we provide ample
						paid time off along with flexible remote work opportunities, we hope that needing to rely on unpaid time off
						is a rare occurrence.
					</p>

					<p>
						Our unpaid time off policy is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate both short- and long-term
						situations. We utilize a two-bucket design to make the approval process more efficient for smaller and more
						infrequent requests, and to give team members more discretion over these requests, while still accommodating
						larger or more frequent requests.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">How it works</h3>

					<p>
						Each team member has access to two unpaid time off buckets in our payroll system—one uses an accrual system
						with a more streamlined approval process and the other is subject to more careful review.
					</p>

					<p>
						Each team member will accrue 2 weeks of unpaid time off each year in their “quick review” bucket. This
						accrued unpaid time off rolls over from year-to-year; however, you can only accumulate a maximum of 2 weeks
						of this unpaid time off at any given time. New employees will begin accruing this unpaid time off during
						their first full pay period.
					</p>

					<p>
						For needs that exceed your “quick review” accrual balance, we also offer a “more review” bucket. Requests
						submitted through this bucket are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by your manager alongside the people ops
						team.
					</p>

					<p>
						During unpaid time off, health benefits will continue;

						missed benefit deductions are caught up.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">How to use</h3>

					<p>
						Unpaid time off can be used by notifying the person you report to as early as reasonably possible and
						gaining approval. Different reasons for requesting time off will naturally have different expectations for
						how early you’re able to send notification. You do not need to exhaust your PTO bucket before using UTO;
						however, you must exhaust your “quick review” bucket in order to use unpaid time off from your “more review”
						bucket.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Impact of using unpaid time off</h3>

					<p>
						Using unpaid time off delays your work anniversary (by the amount of unpaid time off that has been taken)
						for the purposes of determining annual raises,
						<a href="../benefits/anniversary-swag.html">anniversary swag</a>, and
						<a href="../benefits/paid-time-off.html">paid time off</a> accruals. Similarly, the amount of PTO you accrue
						in a pay period is reduced in proportion to the amount of unpaid time off that was taken in that pay period.
