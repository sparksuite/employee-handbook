					<h2 class="display-6">Office closures</h2>

					<p>
						Although we’ve taken steps to prevent the loss of certain utilities (e.g.,
						<a href="../benefits/office.html">redundant power and internet</a>), in the rare event that the office is
						without power, internet, or water for a designated consecutive amount of time, we have established protocols
						for partial- and full-office closures.
					</p>

					<p>
						In many ways, an office closure is like any other unexpected circumstance, where a team member may choose to
						work remotely or take time off—whichever meets their needs best. However, unlike other unexpected
						circumstances, working remotely on a day when the office is partially or fully closed won’t consume a remote
						day.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Partial closure</h3>

					<p>
						While we understand that during a partial closure the office environment won’t be ideal, we allow team
						members to optionally work from the office because we recognize that it may still be their best available
						option if they want to avoid using time off. A partial closure occurs when the office loses power for 1 hour
						or more, as long as backup power is not exhausted.
					</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Full closure</h3>

					<p>The office is unavailable to team members during a full closure, which occurs when the office…</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Loses internet for 30 minutes or more</li>
						<li>Loses water for 1 hour or more</li>
						<li>Loses backup power to our networking equipment</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Notification</h3>

					<p>Team members will be notified via Slack when the status of the office is changed.</p>

					<h3 class="pt-2 h5">Note</h3>

					<p>
						We’ve designed our policies to accommodate all types of unexpected events by affording a great deal of
						flexibility through remote work, paid time off, and unpaid time off. Because our benefits and perks already
						account for these types of unexpected events, in the rare event of an office closure, additional benefits or
						perks will not be granted.
